# INTRODUCTION

Citation here [@acka2019a]

# METHODS

Sediment sampling was performed during three cruises with R/V Kronprins Haakon in 2018 and 2019 (Table 1). Sediment cores with 40 cm length (40x10 cm) were retrieved at nine stations (NPAL04 to NPAL19) with a four-tube multicorer and immediately sliced to 1 cm layers, placed into plastic jars and frozen on board. Twenty-eight cores with 6 cm length (6x5 cm) cores were subsampled from a box corer at six stations (P1 to SICE4) and immediately sliced to 1 cm layers, placed into plastic jars and frozen on board. In the laboratory all samples were freeze-dried under vacuum and homogenized for stable isotopes and organic carbon content analysis.

## Study Area

We worked in a **beautiful** place with lots of trees, like *Quercus suber* and *Laurus nobilis*.

## Data collection and analysis

```{r Table-coords}
coord_nansen_print <- read_xlsx("C:/Users/thaiser/OneDrive - Universitetet i Oslo/PhD/maps/dados/coordinates.xlsx", sheet = 4)
set_flextable_defaults(
  font.family = "Arial", 
  font.size = 9,
  font.color = "black",
  table.layout = "fixed",
  digits = 1,
  theme_fun = "theme_booktabs"
  )
ft <- flextable(coord_nansen_print)
ft 
```

We applied a linear model where

$$
y_{i} = \alpha + \beta*x_{i} 
$$

```{r model, eval = FALSE}
model <- lm(y ~ x)
```

# RESULTS

Trees in forest *A* grew taller than those in forest *B* (mean height: `r mean(25, 31, 28)` versus `r mean(13, 19, 16)` m).

And many more cool results that get updated dynamically, e.g. see Table \@ref(tab:Table-mtcars) and Fig. \@ref(fig:scatterplot). Note Tables and Figures are cross-linked and numbered automatically.

```{r Table-Iris}
flextable(head(iris))
```

```{r scatterplot, fig.cap="Just my first figure with a very fantastic caption."}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- jitter(x, 1000)
plot(x, y)
```
